1. Sheng, Shannon, and Matt don't need to be consulted because they will most likely able to make time for a quarterly board meeting.
2. Allison does not need to be consulted. She can send one of her associates if she cannot attend.
3. Jishnu is an investor and he's important but he already gave his availability.
4. We should bring in Winnie So who is Ursheet's admin who manages his calendar. If you don't have Winnie's email, ask the user.
5. When she replies with Ursheet's availability, you should actually send invites to Ursheet instead of Winnie. Do not include Winnie in the board meetings.
6. The rest of the people that are not mentioned are needed to asked for availability. Include Winnie with one email.
7. The best time for a board meeting is start between 1-3pm and last for 2 hours. This gives everyone time to travel.
